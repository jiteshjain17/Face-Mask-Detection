# Face mask and Social distancing detection
Built a deep learning model which can identify if the person is wearing a mask or not, also detecting if people are violating social distancing norms.
Used **Haar cascade** classifier to detect faces, trained **VGG19** for mask detection and **Euclidean distance** to calculate social distancing violations.
